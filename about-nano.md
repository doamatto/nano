# {{page.title}}

Nano is a super lightweight Jekyll theme built to work great on all platforms, respect user privacy, and load at lightning-fast speeds.

### Installation

You can install Nano is two ways:

**a) Cloning a tag.** You can clone the latest tag or the master branch and [configure based on what's recommended in the wiki of this repo](https://github.com/doamatto/nano/wiki/Configuration).

**b) Installing the Gem.** You can also use `gem install nano-theme` and [configure based on what's recommended in the wiki of this repo](https://github.com/doamatto/nano/wiki/Configuration).

### Roadmap

This project gets updates on occasion, but is not in not an active project. If you have an issue with Nano, please [make an issue report here](https://github.com/doamatto/nano/issues/new). This will allow me to fix the issue as soon as possible and release a patch to RubyGems and to GitHub ASAP.

### Credits

Many thanks to the Jekyll and RubyGems community for great documentation, allowing me to make this simply and swiftly.
