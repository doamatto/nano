title: About doamatto
---

Based in California, I'm a high school student who works on making tools for people, not products. I strive to give people tools that empower them to do amazing things. To empower people there's two things that I'm always consistent with from tool to tool: the way a user interacts with the tool is simple, but powerful and that privacy is given by default.

I have skills in **graphic design**, **software development**, **web development**, and **audio and video editing**. Iâ€™m picking up **3D modeling** and **visual effects**. I've had an interest in homelabbing, server coalitions, Linux, iPods, and jailbreaking/rooting. The projects page, [which can be viewed here](/projects), has plenty of links on archived, current, and concept projects.

Everyone has already pointed out in every single donation system ever made that more money means more time for me to focus. However, I usually end up funding projects out of pocket to pay for server costs and to pay volunteers for their hard work to show my appreciation outside of just a "Thank you." Donations (which can be made [here](https://github.com/sponsors/doamatto)) go straight into the hands of volunteers and to help pay for those servers.

### Cool projects that you would be supporting by sponsoring
All of these projects were founded and are maintained by me and/or a team I manage. These are some of my favourites I've ever worked on.

- **Artam** | A Swiss-army knife for your browser adding plenty of needed features, including some you didn't know you needed
- **Cloud Browser** | A WebKit-based browser built with user privacy, speed, and security in mind
- **SimplyJS** | A lightweight alternative to libraries like jQuery
- **Swift** | A feature rich Discord bot written in Go to allow users to have plenty of power and features with no hassle.
