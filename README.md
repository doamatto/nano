### Credits

Many thanks to the Jekyll and RubyGems community for great documentation, allowing me to make this simply and swiftly.

Big thanks to the StackOverflow community; they helped me find some nice CSS workarounds for some things (like missing images). I quoted the posts I used when I used them.
