title: About doamatto
---

Based in California, I'm a high school student with a habit of making overly complicated tools for very simple problems. I've been working towards making more software aimed to empower others into making their dreams a reality, as well as helping push for better privacy laws and policies.

I have skills in **graphic design**, **software development**, **web development**, and **audio and video editing**. I am currently slowly, but surely, picking up **3D modeling** and **visual effects**. Feel free to explore the projects page to see all the projects I'm currently working on, as well as those I've worked on in the past.

I'm currently interested in homelabbing, privacy-focused tools that also use green energy, coalitions, and Linux.
